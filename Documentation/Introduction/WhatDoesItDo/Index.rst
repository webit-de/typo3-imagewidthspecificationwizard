What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- This backend extension attaches a select field to content elements like
  »textpic« or »images« to provide a set of default values for the width
  of an image

- Using this wizard the editor is able to enter the correct width of an
  image quickly, in stead of wasting time to remember the size of
  certain grids for instance

- The administrator is able to configure default values like “one third
  of the content”, “half of the content”, “image in sidebar” etc.

- If needed, then the administrator is able to allow the selection of
  default values only and deny the use of individual values
